Fundamental decisions
- Self developed MobileFirst WebApp (http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#top)
- Wholesale site rewrite for mobile (explain)
- Rebranding effort may be subtle, but important

- Star / Watch (for updates / notification)
- Demo

Rebrand (look and feel)
- Need options to be presented as several schemes
    !  Font (Heading, Body, Caption)  SIMPLE / CLEAN
    !  Colors (no more than four per scheme)
    !  Logo (must scale well, and be presented consistently)
    !  ...should this work its way into projector images?
    !  Bryan McKelvey (and whomever he chooses as collaborator(s)) should present options for DM group approval by 31Dec16.  

Parenthetically, I am thinking of a way to push content as ASCII into our prescribed format.  This should make the Producer's job easier, and ensure 'branding" compliance.

Sub Groups
- I've emailed Michael Walters and Mike Dearth several times separately.  This is the heart of our programming effort.  Your tasks may require similar internal or external collaboration.

Marketing
Our kids (primary audience) know that we're working on an app but they don't know enough to pass judgement yet.  This puts time pressure on us.  Bryan McKelvey will help us respond to these social dynamics.  We are trying to build effective tools for winning souls in the 21st century.  Let's not stumble onto this stage.

Schedule
I'll work on some more specifics but I hoped to have the design elements set by 2017Q1 and roll an Alpha version Apr 2017 followed by a beta Jun 2017 and full release (GooglePlay/AppStore) by 2017Q3.  We might be able to accelerate this but I am worried about OAuth2 and BlueHost SQL integration.

DM Overview
This is going to bring attention to our efforts generally.  Let's make a VERY good impression.  We have some opportunities:
- Digital Giving - we need to market this - it's a pretty big deal
- Audio broadcasting (simpler, content diversification, tags, rotation)
- Facilities management (Security, thermostat control, IT reporting)
- Solid plan for video

Speak up if you disagree!  You are on this team because you're good at this already.  We need your voice.  I'm being aggressive because it's my job to get us to the finish line.  The harvest field is digital.  God has given us a little more time.  Let's use it for His kingdom.
