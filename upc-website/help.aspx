                You may have discovered that your life seems empty and meaningless. Modern humanity has 
                seen the advancement of science, the explosion of technology, the development of the best 
                of medicine, and, for most, the accumulation of material goods and a multitude of 
                entertainment possibilities. For all of that, most live lives of quiet desperation. The 
                reason is that each is a spiritual being. We are spiritual because we have been created 
                by God. Our unrest, emptiness, purposelessness, comes because we are out of whack. We all 
                have a problem. It is sin. Sin is the result of not doing what we should and doing what 
                we shouldn’t. We just aren’t right, and we know it. Compounding our problem is the 
                reality that there is nothing we can ourselves do to rid ourselves of this sin, to get 
                it right, to cleanse our conscience. Nothing.  Yet, there is hope. Our Creator sent us 
                One who could help us with this problem of ours. His Son Jesus miraculously came to earth 
                as one of us. He came on a mission. He came to die in our place. Being perfectly sinless, 
                He died to pay the penalty and take the punishment for our sin. Each who believes this 
                and calls on His name while confessing his sins will have that which is wrong with him 
                mended. With sin dealt with, a person experiences a newness of life. He is changed. His 
                inner person communes with and knows God. His heart is full, and his life has purpose. If 
                you have not, take a moment to acknowledge that you have a Creator. He is holy and must 
                one day judge sin. Confess that you have sinned. He is love.  He sent His dear and unique 
                Son Jesus to die for our sins. Believe that Jesus did just that. He died for you that you 
                might have spiritual life. Call on Him. You will know amazing, new life.

                Life can turn sour in a hurry. So much can go wrong, and usually does. Things go wrong in 
                our relationships, with our jobs, houses, automobiles, electronic devices, and our bodies. 
                Things go wrong with our minds, our emotions—with our inside. Many times, we discover 
                ourselves in such mess life seems hopeless. There seems to be nothing we or anyone else 
                can do to help us. Things are just going to be as they are or even grow worse. Our life 
                seems unbearably dark. Jesus is Light. His light can shine into your darkness. He said, 
                “I am the Light of the world. He that follows Me will not walk in darkness but will have 
                the light of life.” If your life seems dark, turn to Jesus and ask Him to shine His light 
                into your darkness.  There is no darkness that can hold back His light. Jesus can help you.
