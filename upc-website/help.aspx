                        You may have discovered that your life seems empty and meaningless. Modern humanity has 
                seen the advancement of science, the explosion of technology, the development of the best 
                of medicine, and, for most, the accumulation of material goods and a multitude of 
                entertainment possibilities. For all of that, most live lives of quiet desperation. The 
                reason is that each is a spiritual being. We are spiritual because we have been created 
                by God. Our unrest, emptiness, purposelessness, comes because we are out of whack. We all 
                have a problem. It is sin. Sin is the result of not doing what we should and doing what 
                we shouldn’t. We just aren’t right, and we know it. Compounding our problem is the 
                reality that there is nothing we can ourselves do to rid ourselves of this sin, to get 
                it right, to cleanse our conscience. Nothing.  Yet, there is hope. Our Creator sent us 
                One who could help us with this problem of ours. His Son Jesus miraculously came to earth 
                as one of us. He came on a mission. He came to die in our place. Being perfectly sinless, 
                He died to pay the penalty and take the punishment for our sin. Each who believes this 
                and calls on His name while confessing his sins will have that which is wrong with him 
                mended. With sin dealt with, a person experiences a newness of life. He is changed. His 
                inner person communes with and knows God. His heart is full, and his life has purpose. If 
                you have not, take a moment to acknowledge that you have a Creator. He is holy and must 
                one day judge sin. Confess that you have sinned. He is love.  He sent His dear and unique 
                Son Jesus to die for our sins. Believe that Jesus did just that. He died for you that you 
                might have spiritual life. Call on Him. You will know amazing, new life.

                        Life can turn sour in a hurry. So much can go wrong, and usually does. Things go wrong in 
                our relationships, with our jobs, houses, automobiles, electronic devices, and our bodies. 
                Things go wrong with our minds, our emotions—with our inside. Many times, we discover 
                ourselves in such mess life seems hopeless. There seems to be nothing we or anyone else 
                can do to help us. Things are just going to be as they are or even grow worse. Our life 
                seems unbearably dark. Jesus is Light. His light can shine into your darkness. He said, 
                “I am the Light of the world. He that follows Me will not walk in darkness but will have 
                the light of life.” If your life seems dark, turn to Jesus and ask Him to shine His light 
                into your darkness.  There is no darkness that can hold back His light. Jesus can help you.

                        To be saved is to be made right with God, to be restored to the wholeness God intended, and to be assured of heaven as one’s eternal home.  It is to be born again, to have one’s nature changed. The Holy Spirit works in one’s heart and mind showing him his need of salvation. 
                        If you sense your need to be saved, here is how to respond to the Holy Spirit.                
                Acknowledge that you are a sinner, out of fellowship with your Creator.
                “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;”  (Rom 3:23)                
                Realize that the consequences of your sin is death, ultimately, eternal death which is eternal separation from God (Hell).
                “For the wages of sin is death; …” (Rom 6:23).                
                Also, realize that upon becoming saved one is “given” eternal life (Heaven).  This eternal life cannot be earned.  It is a gift.
                "… but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Rom 6:23).
                Note that Jesus by His coming and dying on the cross paid the penalty for our sins.
                “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (Rom 5:8).
                Confess that Jesus is your savior and call on Him.  This is done by  believing that salvation cannot be earned or deserved but that it is a free gift of God made possible by Jesus’ death on the cross and His resurrection from the grave.
                “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” (Rom 10:9).
                “For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” (Rom 10:13).                
                Rejoice that you are in right relationship with God!  You are saved!  You will go to heaven!
                "Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.” (Rom 5:1-2).

                        Since salvation is a matter of believing, it can also be doubted. Doubt can come from ourselves, the world in which we live, or the enemy of our souls himself.  
                        When you need the assurance you are saved…
                        Remember that your salvation is a matter of what Jesus had done.  It is in His hands.  Trust Him.  You can know you are saved because He does the saving.
                        “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.” (Eph 2:8-10)
                        Realize that your salvation is based on God’s character.  He is faithful.  He is unchanging.  He is true to His word.  You can know you are saved because God is trustworthy.
                        “God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.”  (1Co 1:9)
                        Recognize the Holy Spirit’s witness.
                        “The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:” (Rom 8:16)
                        Rely on the Word of God.
                        There are many verses that share of the promise of salvation that can give assurance.
                        Rest knowing you are saved.
                        “… for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.” (2Ti 1:12).
