    <h4><b>History</b></h4>
</div>
    <p>In the 1920’s, Laura Shank was given a vision of a harvest being reaped in a church that she was to 
        start. Though she could not read and was seemingly alone in her hunger for the Holy Spirit, she 
        followed God’s leading. She was moved to begin a children’s Sunday school on her front porch. They 
        soon outgrew the porch as not only children but parents attended!  They moved into their first 
        building known as Crown Avenue Church in 1926.  Continuing to grow, they built a new church on 
        Mia Avenue in 1952.  In 1954, Sister Shank (in failing health) relinquished ,the pastorate to  
        Vearl Vaughn became the new pastor due to Sister Shank’s failing health.  whoBrother Vaughn had 
        been saved at Crown Avenue and had assisted Sister Shank in the church.  The still growing 
        congregation relocated to the current location, Union Road. Brother Vaughn became a leader in a 
        community of churches in the Miami Valley and the congregation at Union Road grew to 350 under 
        his guidance. In 1985, Brother Vaughn’s health declined and Derwin Ward became pastor and blessed 
        the congregation with his musical talent as well as preaching of the Word. Five years later, he 
        resigned. In 1991 Rev. Clifford Hurst, an instructor at Ozark Bible Institute was called by God 
        to carry on the vision, strengthening the congregation and reinforcing Biblical principles. The 
        experiences, teachings, and Biblical living of classic Pentecost are still preserved in what is 
        now Union Pentecostal Church.</p>
