        <h2>TAKING THE KNEE</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
            Taking the knee was reinserted in the news this past week after President Trump’s cancelling of a planned White House visit of the Eagles, last year’s Super Bowl winners, in consequence to the team’s maneuvering on the meeting.  While reporting on this recent installment in the taking-the-knee-during-the-National-Anthem saga, Fox News showed a photo of Eagle players kneeling on the field.  The only problem was that the players were not kneeling in protest of the National Anthem but were, in fact, kneeling in prayer.   This saga all began in the preseason games of 2016 when 49er Colin Kaepernick, ostensibly to protest police brutality and racial inequality, took the knee during the game opening singing of the National Anthem.   The understood tradition is that during the National Anthem people stand and place their right hands over their hearts to show respect and gratitude for our country, its flag, and for the men and women who have served and fought to protect us.  Thus, to kneel in protest, many believe, is to show disrespect and contempt.  Fox News has apologized for using the photo of praying players to report on protesting players, but what struck me was that kneeling to pray can now be mistaken as kneeling in protest.  The protest during the singing of the National Anthem has forever altered the symbolism of a kneeling figure.  Previously in our culture, a culture formed by and permeated in a Christian world view, taking a knee was almost universally seen as an act of humbling oneself before God to ask something of Him.  Or more simply, taking a knee was understood as a posture of prayer, a posture reminiscent of showing obeisance to a king, the posture of a loyal subject petitioning for a request or of a surrendering foe pleading for mercy.  Although, perhaps, some accounts are apocryphal rather than actual, scenes of leaders taking a knee have dotted the upward forward advancement of our country—scenes from the Pilgrims kneeling at Plymouth Rock to General George Washington kneeling in the snow at Valley Forge to soldiers kneeling before the D-Day invasion to Uncle Sam depicted kneeling praying for victory over communism in the Cold War to Martin Luther King of the Civil Rights movement kneeling in the streets.  But, now the act and symbol of taking a knee has been changed from an image of prayer to an image of protest.  The posture of kneeling reflects one’s inner attitude.  The question now must be, Which attitude?   One of protest and defiance?  Or one of humility and beseeching?  Honestly, what would help our country and our people most is not taking a knee to protest but taking a knee to pray.  That would be a welcomed sight indeed.  Instead of taking a knee against our country, its authorities, its problems what if people took a knee to intercede for our country, our people, our leaders?  Of course, if a photo were taken of folks kneeling and praying for God’s help, a caption would be necessary to note they were kneeling in prayer to prevent the mistaken assumption that they were kneeling in protest.  One thing is for sure.  God needs no caption to know which folks are doing.  One day every person ever born will take the knee before Jesus.  Not a one will do so in protest.
