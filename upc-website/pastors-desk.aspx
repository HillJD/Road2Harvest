        <h2>Amnesia of Changing Positions</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
           Impatience has its benefits.  It can enable you to observe realities of life you might otherwise miss.  As one that rushes through life in high gear, I am often consternated by being held up by a putt-putting car in front of me, someone idly standing in and blocking a doorway, or what just again happened in Wal-Mart parking lot:  Having just let my passenger out at the entrance, I waited for an exiting couple to cross in front of me.  They continued walking straight ahead down the lane between the rows of parked cars.  I notice, not far down that lane, a convenient, vacant parking place.  Elated, I switched my left blinker on, turned down the lane, and immediately had to hit my brakes.  The man and woman at a sloth’s pace were walking right in the middle of the lane making it impossible for me to pass around them.  As I crawled along behind them at a speed too slow to register on the speedometer, impatient to get the vacant parking spot, I wondered, “Why do people do that?”  A lane through the rows of parking spaces, is 30 feet wide.  If folks heading towards their cars would walk to one side or the other, there would be plenty of room for a vehicle to pass them by.  Instead many times some folks slowly slough right down the middle of the lane.  This time, instead of becoming upset, I got philosophical.  “Now,” I reasoned, “this couple is on the way to their car.  That means that at least one of them is going to drive.  I am sure that, if they were driving down a parking lot lane trying to get a parking place or trying to exit, they would also become uptight if someone were walking right down the middle, blocking their way, and forcing them to drive at snail speed.  I know they would not like it.  Why then are they blocking my way?”  I would not begin to assign to them the malicious intention of doing it on purpose to aggravate drivers like me.  No.  It can’t be that.  The obvious reason is that they just don’t think about it.  They are oblivious to what they are doing.  Transiting from driver to pedestrian, they quit thinking like a driver.  Often, people become someone else behind the wheel.  An otherwise calm, pedestrian becomes maniacal when he drives.  Well, the transition the other way must be true as well.  A driver upset by a pedestrian delaying or blocking his progress, doesn’t even think of his own delaying or blocking drivers when he himself is walking.  Thus, the impeding walkers in front of me, had totally forgotten what it was to be a driver in the parking lot.  They experienced the amnesia of having changed position.   This is often the case in life:  When things are going well in our lives, we often are exasperated by, critical of, impatient with the behavior of folks who are struggling.  How can we be that way?  We have forgotten what we were like when we were struggling.  The older forget what it was like to be a hormonal adolescent.  Those who are financially prospering, forget what it was like not to know how they were going to pay the bills due at the first of the month.  The married forgot what they felt when it appeared that they would never meet a life partner.  The well established forget what it was like to be new, unknown, friendless.  Having served God for decades, some forget what it was like just to have been saved and facing an all out attack of Satan and persecution from peers.  So, as I was asking myself, “Don’t these lane-blocking, snail-paced, walkers remember what it is to be driving and having their way blocked,” I sudden heard an inner retort, “Don’t you remember what it’s like to be walking through a parking lot, preoccupied with your thoughts and not realize you were holding up someone trying to drive around you? How much more understanding of folks we would be if we’d only remember what it is like to be in those other folks’ position.  Don’t honk.  Remember.
