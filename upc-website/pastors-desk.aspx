        <h2>Dolls on the Roof</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
            Have you ever attempted to recall the moment in life when you recognized what thankfulness or, rather, unthankfulness was?  For me it happened out on the desert floor between the mountains on the Navajo Reservation.  I was around eight or so and spending part of my summer vacation with my uncle and aunt who were missionaries there.  (I have no intent in what I am about to share to reflect negatively on the Navajo people nor on children.  All people groups and all children have their own examples and moments of ingratitude.  It is inherent in the human heart and nature.  This is only my experience and does not suggest that I was any more grateful than these in my story.)  Already at that age I was enthralled with the “out west” culture and was thrilled to accompany my uncle on some pastoral and evangelism visits out on the desert.  Driving off-road right across the barren terrain or even down inside a wash, my uncle bounced us from hogan to hogan, many built in the same manner they had been for centuries.  The new, unfamiliar sights riveted me.  I was mesmerized by  our visit to the medicine man’s hogan and my uncle’s telling me afterwards that we two were, perhaps, the only two white “men” who had ever been allowed inside.  But, it was the sight of something familiar among the unfamiliar sights that really caught my attention.  Driving up to a hogan, I was startled and appalled by something connected to home 700 miles away.  On top of its dirt roof, abandoned, bleached by the sun, and soiled by the blowing sand were Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls.  I recognized them.  Our church supported my uncle and aunt’s mission.  The ladies of the missionary society in our church cut out and stitched these dolls to send to the children of the mission.  Seeing those weathered dolls, now dulled and lackluster, I had an epiphany of the nature of unthankfulness.  I do not know why or how I made the connection.  It just hit me hard and stuck with me throughout life.  I immediately thought of all the hard work and loving care the ladies had put into the creation of those dolls only to have them thrown and discarded up on a dirt roof.  Something seemed to me awfully ungrateful and sad about that.  Now, I do not know if the dolls had truly been abandoned.  That may just be where they stored them when not playing with them.  Or, perhaps, those of that culture could not be expected to appreciate such dolls.   Or, maybe there was just an ornery, older brother there that tormented his younger siblings by throwing their toys on top of the hogan.  This experience has not only stuck with me but has been a guide in my life.  I have learned that thankfulness is three dimensional:  First, thankfulness is the awareness of the benefit one has received.  Second, thankfulness is the expression of that awareness.  Third, thankfulness is the gladness that comes with the awareness and expression.  There is so much to be said here but too little room.  Thankfulness begins with awareness, consciousness—often of the intrinsic value, cost, etc., of what has been given us.  Sometimes, however, it is not an awareness of the value of the gift as much as an awareness of the act of giving of which we have been chosen to be the recipient.  One Sunday morning one of the children in Children’s Church saved three M & M’s he had been given as a snack, and, as soon as he entered the sanctuary at the close of service, he came found me, looked at me with eyes lit with the joy of giving, and said, “Here, these are for you.”  Opening his hand palm up, he offered me melting M & M’s the colors staining his grubby palm.  All of our thankfulness is unknown to the one who showed us kindness if we do not express it.  We need to express it as much as our benefactor should hear or see it.  If we are truly conscious of the benefit we have received, we will humbly be joyful.  Someone thought of us.  Sacrificed for us.  Loved us.  Benefited us.  Again, the joy goes beyond the gift to the giving itself.  Perhaps, this Thanksgiving we should pull down off the roof of forgottenness and abandonment those gifts we have received.  Taking another look at them, we could become conscious of the benefit, express our gratefulness, and know the joy of both being an recipient and expressing our thanks.  Is your doll still up on the roof?
