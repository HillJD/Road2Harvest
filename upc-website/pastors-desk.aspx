        <h2>DON'T INTERRUPT WHILE I'M INTERRUPTING</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
           One of the ironies of our modern society is how outraged people can be over someone's words or actions while they themselves are guilty of the same. It has been discovered that some of the male leaders of the #MeToo movement, who were among the loudest voices in decrying those who abused women, were themselves abusing women. In recent days commentators have taken great umbrage at tweets that have described individuals with offensive language and terms. Yet, many of those very commentators make a practice of lobbing haranguing insults at those who have opposing views. Winston Churchill surrounded at the table with his guests and family always instigated debate on various topics after a meal. Following one meal, Randolph, his son, was trying to make his point. Winston broke in to argue against it. Randolph tried to continue by over talking his father. Churchill barked at him, "Don't interrupt me when I am interrupting." At least he was honest. Although never admitted, confessed or articulated, this is the attitude of those of post-modern society: "Don't judge (evaluated) me when I am judging (condemning) you." "Don't infringe on my freedom of speech (heckling) when I am violating yours (giving a speech)." “Don't demean my faith (subjective unrealities) when I demean yours (orthodoxy).” “Don't label me for who I am when I malignantly mislabel you.” “Don't point out my real hypocrisies when I erroneously paint you as a hypocrite.” “Don't call me mean-spirited when I condemn you as mean-spirited simply for disagreeing with someone's views.” “Don't call me racist when I call you racist simply because you have white skin.” No, you will never hear these confessions. Yet, this is the blatant hypocrisy that permeates our society today. All of this comes from making the individual autonomous. Each is the creator of his own truth, definer of his own terms, and judge of his own actions. He judges himself by his own truth. He judges others by another standard. There is one standard for himself (the subjective one he designs for himself), and another standard for others. Yes, Churchill’s "Don't interrupt while I am interrupting" is an honest, though proud and, perhaps, unintended confession of hypocrisy. Yet, in the Lord's Prayer I find the same kind of pattern but used in a positive way that could have a transformative effect both on the one who sincerely enunciates it and upon the society in which he lives. Here it is: "Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us."</p>
