        <h2>The Emerging Church Emerged From Where?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
           Before our eyes, American Christianity is morphing into something other than Christianity, and few seem to realize it. It is being transformed, or rather, deformed by an insidious movement and force. Church members may have never heard of it, yet many have embraced its message and sway to its music. Affected preachers may disclaim involvement, even swear and insist they don’t believe it; yet, their preaching, their vision, their manner of conducting services is driven by the books, workshops, and ideas of this movement’s leaders. This movement recently has made deep inroads indiscriminately into every distinctive denomination of orthodox Christianity from Pentecostal to Southern Baptist. Even some of those with whom we have worshiped have been infected by it.
          </p><p>   
What is “it”? It is the Emergent or Emerging Church movement. What is that? It is such a hodgepodge, eclectic movement that to define it, one has said, is like nailing Jell-O to the wall. Since it is so hard to define, I will attempt to describe it:
 </p><p> 
Basically, the emergent says, “The world has changed, so we Christians must change the way we do church in order to appeal to today’s world.” We must “emerge” from traditional Church. The movement accurately realizes the millennial and coming-of-age generation is post-modern. Instead of asking how it can communicate the Gospel as it is to the post-modern culture, the emerging movement asks how it can make Christianity and the Church acceptable and palpable to the post-modern culture.
      </p><p> 
Here’s the rub: Post-modern culture of today has totally rejected absolute truth. Everything is relative. Each person picks and chooses his beliefs and creates his own, customized, individual truth. Doing so, each creates his own reality. There is no Truth. There is only my truth, your truth, his truth. So how does the church make itself acceptable to the post-moderns?
 </p><p> 
First, by questioning each of those “absolutes” that Christianity believes and the Bible teaches; this is done by accepting that each can have his own valid and unique interpretation of the Bible: Sometime ago I told a friend, as we chatted about emergent church leaders, “You, watch. It will not be long until they accept homosexuality.” Today, many of the leaders are openly saying the Church should accept homosexuals and same-sex married couples as validly Christian and that the Bible doesn’t really condemn them.
      </p><p> 
Second, by being inclusive: If all is relative and each’s truth is equally valid, then we must be inclusive of all beliefs and those that espoused them. We must accept, regardless of their origins, the beliefs, ways of worship, types of (non-Biblical) prayer, of any people. Thus, many of the new ways of worship, praying, singing, in the modern church have New Age, Eastern Mysticism, and even Wiccan roots. The mindless, repetitive music and lyrics, the swaying and chanting, of much of the worship being embraced in American churches is the result of syncretizing Christian worship with the mysticism of non-Christian religions and ideologies.
 </p><p> 
Third, anything in the Christian vocabulary and language that the modern society finds offensive must be eradicated from our churches: I agree the church uses a lot of archaic jargon understood only by traditional church folks. However, it isn’t just jargon that the emerging church wants to redact and remove. It is the Biblical language. It is words like “hell,” “torment,” “weeping and wailing,” “repent,” “judgment.” These, they say, turn society off. The leaders don’t even consider that the words they say the Church should quit using are largely Jesus’ words. If you don’t use Biblical words, you then can question all Biblical language. Some emergent leaders are already advocating referring to God, or at least the Holy Spirit, as “She.”
      </p><p> 
Fourth, since all beliefs are equally valid, labels are never to be used. Labels are not to be used because they indicate that some people are “in” and some people are “out.” There are no saved/not saved, Pentecostal/non-Pentecostals, Armenians/Calvinist, Protestants/Catholics, us/not us, etc. There are no distinctions because all beliefs are equally valid, thus, all are “in.”
           </p><p> 
I am out of space, so just one thing more: Probably, the word “emerging” was used of this new way to do church to mean the Church was emerging from its archaic traditions and beliefs to become new and known to today’s society. However, I have my idea from where it truly emerged—and it’s not from the Bible or the true Church of Jesus Christ. The emergent message IS new. It IS embraced by today’s society. It simply ISN’T the message that Jesus and the apostles preached.</p>
