        <h2>The “I AM” and The “i am”</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
           You may think it is only a coincidence of semantics. After all, are we to avoid any use of the first-person-singular being verb “to be” and never say “I am”? Personally, I don’t see a coincidence or semantics. I see design. How is it that God’s declaration of His proper name “I AM,” and Jesus’ “I Am” proclamation when He revealed His divinity while on earth have become the prompted, self-proclaimed, “I am” mantra of adherents of the Motivational Self Help/Self Esteem movement? (See last week’s blog for an example of people’s declaring “I am ___.). Just take a look at a three-paneled picture: First, there’s God at the burning bush instructing Moses to go to Pharaoh and tell him to let the children of Israel go. Moses foresees a problem with the people and asks God, “When I tell the children of Israel that the God of their fathers sent me to you to bring them out of bondage and they respond with ‘What is His name,’ how shall I answer them.” God answers with that great, meaning-filled declaration of His proper name: “Tell them that ‘I AM THAT I AM,’ that ‘I AM’ sent you.” Second, there’s Jesus, when harassed and harangued by Jewish authorities being asked how He could claim to predate Abraham. He responds using a deliberate violation of grammarian law of tense, “Before Abraham was, I AM.” The Jews knew exactly what Jesus was proclaiming. They reached for stones to kill Him for blasphemy. Jesus had just proclaimed Himself the “I AM”—God. Third, there is we spiritually-scrawny, finitely-challenged specimens of fallen carnality being instructed to stand and audaciously make our own declaration, “I Am.” By the human declaring his “i am” (The lower case “i” is intentional) he is basically saying he doesn’t need God’s “I Am.” I read the title of the Apostle’s of the Motivational Gospel best seller, The Power Of The I Am, and I want to believe it is a book about the Power of the I AM—Yahweh, God. But, alas, it’s not. It’s NOT about the power of the “I Am,” God’s power; it is about the power of the” i am,” human power and potentiality. When did the power of THE I AM become not enough? When did it become necessary to discover and unleash the power of my puny i am? In reality, the Motivational Gospel of Self-Help/Self-Esteem teaches the power is not in THE I AM, or even in me as the i am. The power is in my reality-creating words, the positive profession of my words, my very act of declaring, “i am.” So, as the i am, my word is creative just like the Word of THE I Am. You may believe this is all semantics. I don’t. I see it as a satanic orchestrated replacing of The I AM with the i am. This all rather reminds me of Shirley MacLaine, actress and New Age proponent of the ‘80’s, and her autobiographical book and movie, “Out On A Limb.” Instructed that she thinks too little of herself, needs to love herself more, and, thus, should proclaim she is god, she stands on the beach at sunset facing the ocean with arms outstretched and declares over and over, “I am god.” How is this any different than those in Motivational Gospel churches standing and declaring their “i am’s”? Is this truly only coincidental semantics? Or is Satan truly trying to take the “I AM” from God and give it to another? I have a better, more helpful confession: “I am NOT. He is!” And, in my life’s struggles, journey, and formation, what I am not, He will be! I am one other thing—content to let God be the I AM.</p>
