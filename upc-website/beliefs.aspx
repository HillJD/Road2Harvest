                speaking in tongues as the Spirit gives utterance.

                We believe in Sanctification, that it is the cleansing of the heart from inbred sin, 
                the changing of the carnal nature to the divine nature, and that it is wrought by the 
                application of the blood of Jesus Christ through faith and consecration to God and that 
                this experience of grace is subsequent to the new birth.
